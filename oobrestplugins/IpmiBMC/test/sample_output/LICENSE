If this notice is still in the code when it is committed, it means that
Jonathan has not taken the time to generate his own output, and that the
commit should immediately be given -2 and REJECTED.

When all of the sample files are replaced with our own output,
this notice will be removed.

Until then, this file exists to prevent Jonathan from stupidly pushing
text that he did not intend to, because he did not write it.
