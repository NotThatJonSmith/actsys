Test Development:
==================
This document describes how to use these tests and any docker related
limitations.


Prerequisites for testing are:
===============================
* python 2.7.* (should be pre-installed)
* pylint (use you favorite package manager like apt-get, yum, or zypper)
* py.test (use you favorite package manager like apt-get, yum, or zypper)
* pytest-cov (use PIP to install this dependency; use google to figure out how
  to install PIP for your specific platform)

Running tests:
===============

NOTE: All unit tests are expected to run without hardware or system
      dependencies. Your tests should mock all necessary calls to function for
      instance in docker.

In the root git folder type the following command:

$ make test

These tests can be run from a pycharm configuration for
"Python tests->Unittests" as a "Test all in folder" configuration.


Coverage:
==========
Run the coverage task in the Makefile in the root of the repo.

$ make coverage

This can by run from a pycharm configuration for "Python" not "Python tests".

A ".coverage" file will be created as well as a ".html" folder with a web
version of the report.
